# Testing

1. When writing new code, always write tests alongside the implementation, aim
   for 100%+data coverage.
2. When modifying an old piece of code, treat it as writing new code.
3. Keep a testing quota for legacy code which is not frequently touched.
   Dedicate time over period (a day a week, etc.) to write tests for legacy code
   which isn't being modified.
