# [Kanban in Organizations Part II](https://www.projectwizards.net/en/blog/2019/01/kanban-corepractices)

## What is a workflow system?

- Using the Kanban method, you can define, manage, and improve organizations
  that provide value-oriented services to customers as systems.
- Kanban boards are workflow systems in which tasks flow through different
  stages of a certain process from left to right.
- Kanban boards must signal and restrict parallel (work-in-progress, WIP) work
  between the point of commitment and delivery.
- Commitment: an agreement between the customer and the service provider with
  the customer requesting a job which the service provider will
  create and deliver and customer will accept.
- The time between the point of commitment to the point of delivery is the lead
  time (cycle time).
- The Kanban system processes work items on a pull principle - free workers pull
  their own workload from the available tasks.

## The core principles of Kanban

1. Visualize.
2. Limit work-in-progress (WIP).
3. Manage flow.
4. Make processes explicit.
5. Implement feedback loops.
6. Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally.

## Core practice 1: visualize

- Value: **transparency**.
- Use a Kanban board for visualizing work to be done.
- Visualize the entire work process (transparency).
- Could be a whiteboard with sticky notes or an electronic board with cards.
- Use columns to separate states of a single work item through the work process.
- Move tickets on the board from left to right, from column to column to signal
  the work item's current status.
- Each ticket should display:
    1. who works on what,
    2. what states are the work items in, how close they are to their
       completion,
    3. which work is currently blocked.
- Visualizing helps developing a feeling of safety regarding the state of the
  system.
- Kanban visualization should
    1. make the demand for taking action visible,
    2. help employees make good decisions.
- The board can be improved quickly and cheaply.
- Self-improving system:
    1. Kanban system organizes the work,
    2. People organize themselves around the work,
    3. From the new perspective, people see how the Kanban system could organize
       work better than it does at the moment and subsequently they change the
       system for the better.

## Core practice 2: limit work-in-progress (WIP)

- Value: **balance**.
- WIP limits help coordinating the pull system by restricting the number of work
  items the cycle may contain.
- If a state has been filled with tickets to its limits, no additional work can
  proceed to that state until one item moves out of said state.
- These limits signal availability of resource (for example manpower).
- The work moves right on the board towards completion, this causes the
  availability signals to move to the left (upstream).
- The period of time a work item needs to move through the entire system is the
  lead time of the Kanban system - it may be vastly different from the customer
  perspective lead time.
- Limits ensure the amount of work does not exceed the available capacity,
  prevents overloading.
- Prioritizing completion over starting new work improves quality by improving
  focus, cycle time and feedback frequency.
- In case of feeling the limits to be set incorrectly, start a discussion and
  research.
- Too high limits can cause items to be stuck, too low limits can cause
  stagnation, investigate before adjustments.
- Limits are a mechanism for feedback and drivers of system-wide improvements.
- Delays and multitasking have a negative impact on quality.
- There are work items driven by deadlines and urgencies.
- Prioritize on-time work when the deadline is at risk.
- Experiment: do the long-term work in the background (risk-based
  categorization) to develop product, process or employee skills.
- Planning rules may guide the decision which work item should be worked on with
  what priority in order to achieve good results.
- It is important to consider sufficient buffers of immaterial and standard work.

## Core practice 3: Manage flow

- Manage the workflow to achieve consistency, punctuality and good economic
  results, while anticipating customer needs.
- Value: **customer focus**, **workflow**.
- If you look at your work from someone else's perspective, you are likely to
  learn something new about how it operates.
- Inspect the board from right to left:
    1. Whose needs are examined in this part of the process? Whose needs are not
       addressed and what are the risks? (Also treat internal stakeholders as
       customers if they have a veto right.)
    2. What do we learn in this phase that we could not already know or learn in
       an earlier phase? In what way do the activities in this phase help us to
       achieve what we need or the customer needs?
    3. What else do we need to learn? Can we better address ambiguities going
       forward or backward in the process?
- With the help of this logic, a knowledge can be developed to meet customer
  needs yet being undiscovered or unexplored.
- Don't overly trust a secure process to do your job, look for ways to learn
  more effectively.
- Shift mentally from the past to the future.
- Use your Kanban board to remember it over and over again: What do we not know?
- Consistency of delivery and punctuality play an important role in the value of
  workflow.
- How do we recognize that work begins to be in progress?
    1. Good number of work item moves on a short time bases (if progress is not
       visible it is advisable to divide large work items into smaller tickets),
    2. Good number of work items are free of blockages, current and future
       progress can be recognized.
    3. The feeling of completing work faster and more predictably, lead times
       are shortening.
- If you cannot see these signs, you have a goal; if you see these signs you can
  ask yourself whether you can improve further.
- In order to improve further, work backwards: start from the right side and
  consider what keeps the work from moving smoothly towards completion.
- Focus on the flow and ask these questions for the columns:
    1. How do work packages leave this process step? What criteria tell us that
       they are ready? How is this readiness signaled so that downstream action
       can be taken?
    2. How much time do work packages usually spend in this state? How much time
       do they spend in active work as opposed to just waiting?
    3. What are the biggest sources of unpredictability? Do they have their
       origin in work or waiting time? Are the relevant units waiting for
       internal availability or for external dependencies to dissipate?
    4. How much capacity in this state is consumed by rework?
    5. How do work packages arrive in this state? How do we know that they are
       ready for processing?
- Kanban is not about individual production or team production alone.
    (This means you shouldn't limit yourself to the problems you can solve
    alone.)
- Work with other people on larger problems that run through the overall system.
- Collaboration does not only help you to finish things, it ensures that your
  collaborative efforts focus on the essentials.
- Although Kanban has committed itself to self-organization, it is advisable to
  accompany the most important work packages more closely.
- It's okay for high-value work packages to bypass queues if you can justify it
  with a business benefit, even if overall predictability suffers.

## Core practice 4: make processes explicit

- Value: **transparency**.
- Helps maintaining common understanding of operating the system in an effective
  manner.
- Making the implicit process rules explicit practices the transparency value.
- Process rules should only be used to make better and predictable decisions.
- There are various process rules:
    1. ticket definition criteria: for example, tickets selected for development
       should have a detailed description regarding the requirements for being
       done or such tickets shouldn't require more than five days work in
       development, etc.
    2. global rules: if a new item is pulled the client is informed in case of
       it affecting existing work.
    3. use keywords such as demo or review, to identify commonly understood
       states of the work being done.
- No such rule is universally appliable, but they are transfarable to comparable
  contexts and context is important.
- Start with simple process rules that reflect current practice and refine as
  needed (start with what you are doing).

## Core practice 5: implement feedback loops

- Value: **transparency**.
- Early feedback helps not to overlook signs of an unhealthy system.
- Through feedback loops, transparency becomes an effective and targeted driver
  of change.
- Standup:
    - regular (daily) meetings,
    - short,
    - everyone should stand,
    - go through the work items from the board right to left,
    - put emphasis on work items blocking the workflow or being risky,
- The goal of the standup is making your decisions more transparent:
    1. what you should work on and how to do so,
    2. when you should take targeted action to support and advance a work
       package,
    3. when you should monitor how the system really works.
- The standup's social aspect helps building the team spirit.
- The team members both gain an overview of the team's bigger picture while also
  getting an insight into the work of other team members facilitates better
  understanding.

## Core practice 6: improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally

- Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally (use models and the scientific
  method).
- Value: **collaboration**.
- Improve objectives cooperatively: part of the creative energy should be used t
  optimize the underlying delivery system.
- Feedback cycles involve several people working together (cooperatively) on one
  thing.
- When teams work self-organized, improvements and innovations develop from
  collaborations that arise from the fact that the appropriate group of
  employees are automatically involved.
- It is important to encourage cooperation and focus on it.
- It is important to focus on the quality of the individual interactions.
- Identify key processes that are slowed down by low quality interactions,
  delays, back-and-forth conversations, rework and frustration.
- Evolve Experimentally: the Kanban method is based on the concept of a process
  for problem solving, apply this process repeatedly in an improvement cycle.
- PDMA cycle for continuous improvement:
    1. **Plan**: plan an experiment based on a hypothesis.
    2. **Do**: execute the experiment.
    3. **Check**: check the result of the experiment.
    4. **Act**: act on the results by changing the hypothesis or the system
       accordingly and share the learning outcomes appropriately with others.
- Requires high degree of discipline to implement changes according to
  scientific procedures.

## The values of leadership, understanding, agreement and respect

- Each of the practices opens up many opportunities to practice leadership.
- The values **understanding**, **agreement**, **respect** are each one area of
  leadership and represent one of the Kanban basic principles:
    1. Start with what you are doing.
    2. Agree to pursue improvement through evolutionary change.
    3. Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities & titles.
    4. (Encourage acts of leadership at every level.)
- Respect the current structure of your company and do not exclude anyone.
