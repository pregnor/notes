Source: https://www.projectwizards.net/en/blog/2018/11/kanban-organizations

## What is Kanban?

- Method for visualizing work.
- Gives a common understanding of work being done (rules for work,
  time-accomplishment relationship, work result quality).
- Gives predictability and sustainability to work.
- Improves communication and collaboration.
- Increases quality.
- Helps organization level alignment to achieve strategic goals.
- Focuses on structured design of commitments and balanced workflow.
- Increases agility.
- Provides a way to react to changes in a natural way as part of the everyday
  workflow.

## The Kanban values

- Mutual respect: all persons contributing to a common company must be respected.
- Respect is the foundation on which the other values are built.
- System of 9 values.

### 9 values

1. **Transparency**: by an open exchange of information and a clear and
   unambiguous vocabulary you create transparency in all areas.
2. **Balance**: you are efficient if you balance the different requirements,
   views and abilities of all participants among each other.
3. **Collaboration**: the Kanban method improves the way people work together,
   collaboration is therefore one of its key points.
4. **Customer Focus**: the customers and the value (asset) they receive are the
   natural centre of interest of all persons involved in the company.
5. **Workflow**: work represents a continuous or occasional flow of values, an
   important starting point in using Kanban is to recognize and maintain such a
   flow of work.
6. **Leadership**: leadership is required at all levels to generate value and
   achieve an improved state.
7. **Understanding**: understanding means first and foremost self-awareness,
   both from the individual employee as well as from the entire organization to
   move forward, Kanban is a method of improvement and improvement requires
   change, which in turn requires understanding, once you have identified a
   particular problem, you determine cause and effect, this means you need to
   understand your work and the processes involved first in order to improve it:
   start with what you are doing and understand why you are doing it.
8. **Agreement**:  in an agreement, all parties agree to pursue goals together,
   different opinions and approaches must be respected, these different points
   of view should converge, this rapprochement arises from the joint commitment
   of the persons involved to improve all processes necessary for the joint
   achievement of the objectives.
9. **Respect**: respect for people in the form of appreciation, understanding
   and consideration is the foundation on which the other values are based:
   Start with what you are doing and look at how what you are doing meets or
   does not meet the needs of people inside and outside the organization.

## The Kanban agendas

1. **Sustainability Agenda**:
    - Goal: find a sustainable pace of work and optimize the focus on the inside
        of the organization.
        Create a basis empowering all employees to complete their work in a
        regular rhythm and not to overwork themselves.
    - Means:
        - Create services that balance demand with existing performance. (When
            demand exceeds performance, employees are overloaded with work.)
        - Introduce transparency about the workload and bring it into balance
          with the performance of the employees.
2. **Service Orientation Agenda**:
    - Goal: provide customers with the services which meet the company's
        purpose and meet or exceed the needs and expectations of the customers.
        Kanban is about providing services and continuously improving them.
3. **Survivability Agenda**:
    - Goal: staying competitive and adaptable, continuing successful operation
        in times of significant change.
    - Means:
        - technologies and processes that are currently sufficient must be
          adapted to constant change.

## The foundational principles of Kanban

Kanban has six foundational principles, which are divided into two groups.

### Change Management Principles

1. Start with what you do now:
    - Understand current processes and how they are implemented in practice.
        While the current processes have their obvious shortcomings, they also
        show levels of resilience and sophistication, otherwise they wouldn't
        have achieved to get established over time.
        Even those who work with these processes are usually unable to fully
        assess the complete extent of their advantages or disadvantages.
    - Respect existing roles, responsibilities and job titles.
    - Include every person involved in the company in order to successfully
        master future challenges.
2. Agree to pursue improvement through evolutionary change:
    - Strive for evolutionary improvement at all levels.
        Change should unfold from within your own organization.
    - Determine baseline values for performance and effectiveness based on
        current practice to use for assessing future changes.
    - Do not impose solutions from other organizations, as these have developed
        in a different context.
3. Encourage acts of leadership at every level:
    -

### Service Delivery Principles

1. Understand and focus on your customers' needs and expectations:
    - Focus on needs and expectations of the customers.
        Let their dissatisfaction drive you improving your service with the
        associated workflows and processes.
    - Find out which criteria customers use to judge satisfaction with your
        service.
    - Design a workflow based on these criteria that helps you best meet the
        needs and expectations of your customers.
2. Manage the work; let people self-organize around it:
    - Professional services are among the intangible (non-physical) goods.
        It is knowledge work, which supplies information in different form.
        For this knowledge work you have to create virtual boundaries for the
        ongoing work and learn how to deal with non-determinable buffers.
    - The processes can be seen as a series of knowledge discovery steps with
        their associated rules.
        A Kanban board allows you to make the process visible.
        With its help you can start to manage the work and at the same time
        visualize the goals for your employees.
        Help your employees understand customers with their needs and
        expectations and explain to them the risks involved in delivering the
        service.
        This improves service quality because the entire organization is focused
        on the customers with their needs and expectations, starting from each
        individual employee.
3. Evolve policies to improve customer and business outcomes:
    - Establish guidelines and make them understandable to everyone.
        Only if all stakeholders adhere to these guidelines can they uncover the
        errors they need to change.
        In addition, you are more likely to reach a consensus on issues of
        dispute if you have objective discussions about policies rather than
        subjective blame attributions and there will be less rejection of
        change.
    - Guidelines helps to align with the change management principles.
        As soon as a problem occurs, it must be solved and if a rule no longer
        makes sense, change the rule.
        If you stop changing the rules, you stop the improvement process.
    - Focus on the work, not the people.
