# Agile operations fundamentals

## Pattern introduction

### What is operations?

- Any repeatable process that delivers value to the customer. Unlike a project,
  it normally has no definite start and end date.
- Business as usual.
- Can be in any part of the business.
- Examples: recruitment, budgeting, call centers, supply chain, software
  operations.

### Operation execution pattern

```
|  Mobilize    >     Understand     >     Explore/strategize      >     Build/test/implement    >     Manage/evolve  |
|              |                    |                             |                             |                    |
|              |   Business canvas  |      Business V=Canvas      |        Test hypothesis      |  Roll-out to all   |
|              |                    |                             |                             |  areas and evolve  |
```

### Theory of constraints

You can only deliver as fast as the slowest part of your process. (Every
organization has at any given point in time at least one constrating which
limits the system's performance relative to its goal - Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt:
Form the Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement.)

The key is to find and replace the bottleneck where you want it to be.

## Team

- Social practices:
    - Social contract.
    - Mood marbles.
- Process practices:
    - Visualize work: kanban board, value stream mapping, business V=Canvas.
    - Pull and do the work.
- Improvement practices:
    - Metrics and measures.
    - Point Kaizen.
    - Showcase / retrospective / celebration.

### Identify the process and then the team

### Social practices

- **Social contract**:
   1. Every team gets together for one hour.
   2. They write sticking notes about acceptable and inacceptable behaviors.
   3. This forms a list of behavior the team is going to live by.
   4. This is put up at the team space and the entire team owns it.
   5. Everyone is accountable according to that by all the team members.
   6. Penalties can be added to inacceptible behaviors as a weight.
- **Mood marbles**:
   1. At the team space.
   1. Jar of marbles, lot of red and green marbles in a big bowl.
   2. Another empty glass jar.
   3. Everyday when people come in the morning and when they leave in the
      evening they put one red or green marble in the jar depending on how they
      feel, green - good, red - bad.
   4. At the end of every day it is visible how the team is feeling.

### Process Practices.

- **Agile value stream mapping**:
    - visualizes the process and records the time to do the actual work (green)
      and the waiting time (red) to calculate the process efficiency and
      visualize bottlenecks and improve them.
    - It needs to be across the process, not just a silo.
- **Kanban (signboard) boards**:
    - Visual process management system based on pull mechanism.

### Improvement practices

- **Big visual charts**: simple charts on the walls to track and show problems and
  metrics.
  - Metrics:
     - Cycle time.
     - Throughput.
     - Unit cost.
     - Customer satisfaction.
     - Team satisfaction.
  - Risks.
  - Issues.
  - Team information.
- **Point Kaizen**: each individual in the team doing small things to reduce waste
  and remove bottlenecks.
  - Observe with a view to change.
  - Just make the change.
- **Retrospective**:
   1. What is working well?
   2. What is going wrong?
   3. What was confusing?
   4. Collect key interests of the team based on the 3 categories above by
      aggregating lists of individual interests of the past iteration.
   5. Grouping them results 5-10 key problems the team have.
   6. The team should prioritize them and pick the top 3 to work on.
   7. Ask the team how it could fix those chosen problems until the next
      iteration.
- **Showcase**: at the end of every iteration the team shows the stakeholders
  the achieved results and talks about the encountered problems and confusions.
- **Celebration**.

## Leaders

1. Form the "Team of teams":
    - Catching up with the other leaders.
    - Visualizing the value stream.
    - Having a regular weekly hour long meeting to discuss the process.
2. Set a clear vision, objectives and goals:
    - Vision: what is the endgame for the team.
    - Mission: the purpose why the team does the work.
    - Objectives: .
    - Goals: specific, measureable, attainable, relevant, time-bound.
3. Inspire, engage and empower the team to improve.
    - How do we get better?
    - Clarity of purpose.
    - Iterate, learn and course correct.
    - Self-directed teams.
    - Goal grid:
```
                            Do we have it?
                        No              Yes

        Do      Yes     1. Achieve      2. Preserve
        we
        want    No      3. Avoid        4. Eliminate
        it?
```
4. Help prioritize the funnel.
    - Funnel of operation work: supply chain flows, call center tickets, change
      requests.
    - Funnel of projects: strategic projects, improvement projects, audits,
      not-normally-operational work.
5. Observe work for bottlenecks and waste.
    - Continuously look for waste.
    - Continuously look for bottlenecks.
6. Help remove impediments.
    - Chop wood: breaking down requirements, tasks and subtasks, etc..
    - Carry water: bringing resources to the team (financial, human, etc.).
    - Move boulders: removing impediments.
7. Share, learn and celebrate.
    - Tell me and I forget, teach me and I remember.
    - Involve me and I learn.
    - Create and foster a learning environment.
    - Encourage curiosity and problem solving in small SWAT groups (struggle
      street).
    - Make time to learn.
    - "Fed-Ex" days.
    - Retrospectives and action follow-ups.
    - Innovation contests.
    - Cross-team share and learn brown bag sessions (positive and negative
      experiences).
    - Celebrate.

## Mobilizing for process improvements.

1. Decide on the taget process and scope.
2. Stakeholder mapping.
3. Setup value stream mapping workshop, invite the right stakeholders.

### Deciding on the scope

Level 1 recruitment process:

1

1. Define job requirement.
2. Advertise.

2

3. Select.
4. Offer.

3

5. Onboard.

### Stakeholder mapping

The members present depend on the chosen process scope.

Get a couple of representatives from each groups who know the process well.

1

- HR advisors.
- Team for whom the jobs is.
- Finance for salary.
- Marketing.

2

- Corporate coms.

3

- Suppliers (recruitment companies).
- HR training.

**Improvement champion**: one of the leaders should take responsibility to drive the
improvement initiative.

This person is a true servant leader and facilitates more than directs.

### Workshops

#### Improvement workshop

Maximum 8 hours long.

Agenda:
1. Intro.
2. As-is Agile value stream mapping.
3. Problem definition.
4. Desired outcome BHAG (big, hairy, audacious goals).
5. Solution hypothesis.
6. To-be value stream design actions.

To get shared understanding.

#### Kick-off workshop

- Where?
- When?
- Who?
- How?
- Why?

+ Facilitator.
+ Catering.

## Understand

1. Know your numbers - metrics.
    - Unit cost per transaction.
    - Cycle time.
    - Throughput.
    - Defect rate.
    - Staff morale.
    - Attrition rate.
    - Customer satisfaction: know the trend over the last 6 months at least.
2. Retrospective, 5 whys (root cause analysis).
    - Challanges and blockers.
3. Outcome and value clarity.
4. Current objectives, goals and strategy.
5. Understand your value drivers, one of these are the key focus for a given
   period.
    - Reduce unit cost.
    - Improve cycle time.
    - Increase throughput.
    - Improve customer satisfaction.
    - Improve quality.
6. Value stream mapping (as-is).

## Agile value stream mapping

- Based on the Lean value stream mapping, a light fast version.
- Takes place in a collaborative workshop setting.
- Ideal for business processes as opposed to manufacturing processes.

### Rules

1. Get the key stakeholders together based on the process scope you choose to
   map.
2. Have people who actually do the work present, who knows the current process.
3. Run a facilitated process:
    - Make sure there is sufficient wall space.
    - Workshop duration is maximum 1 day.
4. Keep it simple and low fidelity.
    - Do not use a business process mapping tool, just sticky notes and string.
    - The focus is conversation and shared understanding.
    - Do not try and map all the exceptions - focus on the 80%.
5. The focus is improvement, not blame.

### How to do VSM

- Level 1:
    1. Identify the high level process.
    2. Identify the stakeholders involved in the process.
        - Stakeholder mapping.
    3. Represent the involved stakeholders as swim lanes.
- Level 2:
    1. Map the as-is process within the swim lanes using sticky notes - connect
       with string if needed.
    2. Estimate average activity time per step (AT) and the wait time (WT)
       inbetween steps in minutes.
    3. Calculate the process efficency percentage.
        - Total cycle time (TCT) = AT+WT
        - PE% = (AT/TCT)*100
    4. Can we reduce any wait time or activity time which affects the process
       efficiency the most in the wrong way?
    5. Can we optimize any steps away which are not necessary but take up major
       time?

### Tips and pitfalls:

- Don't go down to task level, stay at level 2 or 3.
- Don't map exceptions, map the 80% flow.
- Make intelligent guesses on the activity time and wait time, don't split hair
  here.
- Map reality - not what it should be or what the process document says it
  should be.
- Don't be surprised how low your initial process efficiency is. Single digit
  numbers are common. See it as a great chance to improve.
- Focus on reducing wait times first, then optimize activity times.
- Keep it simple, don't bother lean icons and rules for now.
- Be hones about why some things take so long.

## Explore

1. Set a big hairy audacious goal: a target the team sets, that helps stretch
   the limits:
   - Quality.
   - Customer satisfaction.
   - Throughput.
   - Unit cost.
   - Cycle time.
   - Team satisfaction.
2. Review your retrospective and root cause analysis.
    - \+
    - \-
    - ?
    - Focus on the top 3 things to get done.
    - Ask the 5 whys.
3. Value stream mapping (to-be)
    - Options for removing bottlenecks.
        - Things that slow or stop the flow.
        - Causes:
            - Complexity of work:
                - Process problem.
                - Input defects.
                - Complex time consuming steps.
            - People:
                - Lack of skills.
                - Lack of training.
                - Lack of commitment.
            - Resources:
                - Insufficient resources.
                - Lack of proper tools.
                - Overburden.
        - Increase the efficiency of the bottleneck:
            - Make sure it's free of defect input.
            - Improve the process, reduce wasteful steps.
            - Automate.
            - Up-skill and train.
            - Reschedule work.
            - Increase work time.
            - Minimize downtime.
            - Add more resources - last option.
        - Decrease the input to bottleneck:
            - Manage the onramp.
    - Options for eliminating waste
        - Muda: anything a customer would not want to pay for.
        - Mura: unevenness, anyting causes loss of productivity.
        - Muri: overburden.
4. Decide on work to be done to improve.

### Improve

#### Kaizen

- Kai == change.
- Zen == good.
- Kaizen == continuous improvement.

#### 5 S improvement

1. Sort.
2. Straighten.
3. Standardize.
4. Shine.
5. Sustain.

There are always multiple solutions of which you can choose the preferred
one(s).

## Test, validate, implement

1. Test your solution hypothesis in an Agile way:
    - Keep the test low-tech, low-fidelity, simple.
2. Validate the outcomes.
3. If successful, implement changes using the Agile program execution pattern.
4. Showcase.

### Test and validate

For each process improvement solution:
1. Define solution and set your desired goal
2. Write acceptance criteria and measures of success.
3. Write test cases.
4. Simulate the solution.
5. Measure the outcome and test against test cases.
6. Validate success.
7. Continue iterating.

### Implement

If the solution needs considerable effort or could cause considerable disruption
then implement the solution as an Agile project.

```
|     Discovery (optional)    |               Delivery (releases or phases)               |
|                             |                                                           |
|     Iteration 0    |     Iteration 1    |     Iteration 2       |     Iteration n       |
|                    |                                                                    |
|        Setup       |                                                                    |
|                                                                                         |
|                                       Iteration n                                       |
|  Iteration planning  |  Daily stand-ups  |  Work  |  Showcase  |      Retrospective     |
|                      |                            |                                     |
|         Ready        |             Run            |                 Wrap                |
```

Standards are stoppers which prevent the Agile process from rolling backwards.

Don't demand perfection, but insist on continuous improvement.

## Metrics and measures

Balanced score card:
- Financial, people, process, customer aspect.
- Financial + people: **unit cost per transaction**, total cost.
- Financial + customer: **customer satisfaction**, **number of defects**, SLA.
- Customer + process: **throughput**, **cycle time**, lead time to start, backlog size.
- Process + people: **team satisfaction**, attrition rate, skills gap.

6 golden metrics:
- Quality.
- Unit cost.
---
- Team satisfaction.
- Customer satisfaction.
---
- Cycle time.
- Throughput.

Balance outcome, behavior and process.

It's about trends, not absolute value.

Avoid vanity metrics: they make you feel good, but are not linked to the
outcome.

Metrics must be:
- Up to date.
- Consistent
- Simple (6-8).
- Visible.

**Discipline, is the difference between good and great.**

## Tips, pitfalls and tricks

### Pitfalls

1. Negative ripple effects, improvements in one area can cause significant loss
   in another.
2. Doing it to the team, rather than having them own the change and be involved.
3. Too many initiatives at the same time.
4. No proper testing of the proposed solution.
5. Lack of measurement discipline.
6. Endlessly long value stream mapping.
7. Paralysis by analysis.
8. Not implementing properly, under resourcing.

### Tips and tricks

1. Tackle an end-to-end process that adds real customer value.
2. Make sure the leaders champion this as well, get champion representatives
   from the teams that do the actual work.
3. Be honest with the current state of crap, see it as a great opportunity to
   improve.
4. Keep the process improvement loops small and regular, 1-2 months.
5. Have fun, celebrate success.
6. Share the learning and the success stories.
7. Don't stop after the first round of success.
