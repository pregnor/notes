# Agile program fundamentals

In-depth explanation of the Agile program pattern.

**Agile program pattern**: a model for applying agile **values, principles,
practices and delivery** of entire programs on the level of **individual
projects**.

1. **Discovering the right work.**
2. **Delivering the work right.**

```

## Situational leadership model

1. **Directing**: high directive, low supportive behavior. Followers generally
   lack the skills required for the task but are eager to learn and willing to
   take direction.
2. **Coaching**: high directive, high supportive behavior. Followers have some
   of the skills needed, but lack any real understanding of how to complete the
   task. These people can't succeed without some help.
3. **Supporting**: low directive, high supportive behavior. Followers are
   capable but lack the confidence or motivation to comple the task on their
   own.
4. **Delegating**: low directive, low supportive behavior. Followers are skilled
   and even experienced at a task, and they are confident and motivated.

Delivery life-cycle
```
|     Discovery (optional)    |               Delivery (releases or phases)               |
|                             |                                                           |
|     Iteration 0    |     Iteration 1    |     Iteration 2       |     Iteration n       |
|                    |                                                                    |
|        Setup       |                                                                    |
|                                                                                         |
|                                       Iteration n                                       |
|  Iteration planning  |  Daily stand-ups  |  Work  |  Showcase  |      Retrospective     |
|                      |                            |                                     |
|         Ready        |             Run            |                 Wrap                |
```

Working further through discovery and delivery narrows the range of uncertanty
down.

## Delivery and iteration basics

1. The work
    - Approved project scope.
2. Resourcing
    - The team.
    - PM & IM.
    - Customer - product.
    - Owner.
    - Budget.
    - Facility - space.

Delivery is made up of multiple releases of increments of the product early and
often in order to benefit from the product sooner and to minimize the risk of
delivering the wrong thing, because we close the feedback loop with our users.

- Iterations are 1-4 weeks long.
- If teams are interrupted during the iteration with priority shifts then the
  iterations are probably too long for the current environment and they should
  shorten the iteration.

### Scrum

- Inputs from customers, team, managers execs to the product owner.
- Product backlog: a prioritized list of what is required features, bugs to fix.
- Loop:
    - Team: sprint planning meeting, the team commits to as much high priority
    backlog as can be completed by the end of the sprint.
    - Sprint backlog: task breakout, input to Scrum master.
    - 1-4 week sprint: sprint and date and deliverable do not change.
    - Daily stand-up meeting: 15-30 minutes.
    - Sprint review.
    - Finished product: product increment.
    - Sprint retrospective.
    - Restart loop.

## Stories

### Story hierarchy
 - Program.
 - Projects.
 - Releases.
    - Epics.
- Iterations.
    - Features.
        - Stories.
            - Tasks.

### User story mapping, the 5 Cs formula

1. **Cards**: write stories on index cards which limits the size by the
PO or the customer.
2. **Conversations**: get the PO and the team on the same page.
3. **Confirmation**:
    - Acceptance criteria is determined and written by the team on the back of
      the index card.
    - All Agile teams must come to an agreement on a definition of done that
      applies to all stories they work on.
4. **Construction**: implementation of the story.
5. **Consequences**: measurable outcome.

### Life of a story, the 3 Es

- Prioritization:

    1. Identification.
        - Sources:
            - Feature breakdown.
            - Design thinking practices.
            - Business canvas.
            - Valut stream mapping (as is, to be).
            - Brainstorming.
            - User/customer interviews.

    2. Story writing.
        - Form:
            - Personas: who (as a).
            - Process: what (want a).
            - Outcomes: why (so that).

## Delivery setup: iteration zero

### Iteration zero

1. Shared understanding of Agile team training.
2. Shared understanding of the project.
3. Social contract.
4. Story elaboration - max 2 iterations ahead.
5. Architecture and design.
6. Standards and guidelines.
7. Tools and environment provisioning.
8. Detailed release planning.

Takes just enough to start - usually the same length as all other iterations.

## Release and iteration planning

### Release plan

**Why**: so we can set targets and milestones for ourselves and socialize
delivery projections with our stakeholders.

1. Prioritize features and stories.
2. Estimate features and stories.
3. Estimate velocity.
4. Fill the iteration buckets.
5. Cater for contingency.
6. Set up the release wall.

Based on empirical process control theory:
- Transparency.
- Inspection.
- Adaptation.

### Iteration plan

**Why**: so we can be clear on what to deliver in the next iteration and prepare
for delivery.

1. Re-estimate hangover stories for left over.
2. Estimate velocity.
3. Fill the iteration first with hangover stories.
4. Pull from next iteration backlog till bucket is full.
5. Update the release plan based on changes.
6. Update walls and burn-up charts, assign work.

### Planning poker

Story points: pseudo-fibonacci sequence to assign story points to stories.
- 0
- 0.5
- 1
- 2
- 3
- 5
- 8
- 13
- 20
- 40
- 100
- ?
- Infinity

1. The product owner reads a story.
2. Everyone on the team selects a card estimating the story's relative size and
   place the corresponding card on the table face down.
3. Then they show the cards to each other.
4. If not all cards match then a discussion follows to reach a shared
   understanding of the relative size of the story.

   Then they go to #2 and do another round.
3. If everyone played the same card, that's the estimation of the story.

The total number of story points the team has committed in an iteration is the
**estimated team velocity**.

The total number of story points the team has actually completed in an iteration
is the **actual team velocity**.

Velocity is best to be **averaged over multiple iterations**.

Release walls show the **work the team is planning to release** in each
iteration.

Iteration walls show the **work the team is working on and the phases the
items** are in during a single iteration.

### Product backlog iceberg

```
                                 ----------------------
                                 | Features and tasks |
                      --------------------------------------------
                      |                  Themes                  |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                         Epics                                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

- **Theme**: a collection of related backlog items.
- **Epic**: a large backlog item.
- **Priority** is continuously refined.

## Iteration execution

Example: 2 week iteration
- Wednesday
    - Iteration planning, 3.5 hours, 5% time.
    - Work, 3.5 hours, 5% time.
- Thursday
    - Work, 7 hours, 10% time.
- Friday
    - Work, 7 hours, 10% time.
- Monday
    - Work, 7 hours, 10% time.
- Tuesday
    - Work, 7 hours, 10% time.
- Wednesday
    - Pre-planning, 7 hours, 10% time.
- Thursday
    - Work, 7 hours, 10% time.
- Friday
    - Work, 7 hours, 10% time.
- Monday
    - Work, 7 hours, 10% time.
- Tuesday
    - Work, 3.5 hourds, 5% time.
    - Showcase + retrospective, 3.5 hours, 5% time.

### Stand-ups

Frequent habit of sharing knowledge about work progress.
1. 1 minute speaking time.
2. What did I do since the last stand-up?
3. What will I do until the next stand-up?
4. Are there any blockers?
5. Can anyone help with the blockers?

- Be punctual.
- Talk to the card.
- What did I do yesterday?
- What's planned and left to do?
- Blockers in reaching deadlines.
- Make notes to discuss offline.
- Keep it short and to the point.
- Take longer discussions offline.
- Make a note of who does not have work.
- Move the card only after talking to it.
- Pull a new card if needed.
- Never embarass anyone up in public.
- Have the hard converstaion in private.
- Update the virtual wall later.

### Huddles and hang outs

Occasional discussions.

- 1 on 1.
- Deep dives.
- Take time to understand the real issues.
- Listen.
- Socialize.
- Praise.
- Talk to stakeholders.
- Get more than one opinion.
- Move boulders.
- Carry water.
- Work closely with the PM and OM.

### Retrospectives

A retrospective is a gathering of a community at regular intervals throughout a
delivery to review the events and learn from the experience. - Esther Derby and
Diana Larsen from Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Times Great.

When the speed of failure slows, so does the speed of invention. - Mike Steep

- Working / not working / puzzles.
- Group and summarize.
- Vote for top 3.
- Root cause analysis.
    - 5 whys
- Pick top 2-3 actions for next iteration.
- Write up cards for it and add to the release wall.

## Big visual charts

- Release wall.
- Iteration wall.
- Burn-up charts.
- Burn-down charts.
- Struggle street.
- Risks.
- Architecture wall.
- Kanban board.
- Stakeholder maps.

## Distributed teams

1. Don't do distributed teams if you can avoid it.
2. Don't treat remotes as they were locals.
3. Don't treat locals as they were remotes.
4. Latitude hurts, longitude kills.
5. Don't always be remote.
6. Invest in the appropriate tools and environments.
7. Establish standards and agreements.

## Tips and tricks

### Story issues

1. Identify.
2. Elaborate.
3. Build.
4. Test.
5. Done.
6. Repeat from step 1.

- Scope creep.
- Hangover stories.
- Changes during the iteration.
- Bugs found.
- Change in the requirement.
- Wrong estimates.
- Epics not stories.
- Unavailable SME.
- BAU.

### Iteration smells

- Missing team members.
- Repeating tasks.
- No impediments raised / same impediments raised day after day.
- 'Directive' IM or PM.
- Specialized job roles / not acting like a team and doing whatever it takes.
