# A Taste of Agile

## What is Agile

Agile is always about one question: **how do I get better?**

### Values

- **Human values** are the foundational beliefs in Agile:
    1. **Trust**: understanding that mutual interest improves collaboration.
    2. **Respect**: achieving peak efficiency by being open to the full
       potential collaboration.
    3. **Openness**: transparency leads to honest results and measurements
       easing the way of improvement.
    4. **Courage**: challenging everything to improve increases performance in
       the long run.
    5. **Culture**: giving a framework for behavior which is the cornerstone of
       collaboration.

These values are **common practices among family and private life** as well.

### Principles

Principles of Agile are based on the human values.

1. **Self-direction**: taking initiative on the path of achievement accelerates
   results.
2. **Thinking**: analyzing the problems help understanding them and also help
   finding better solutions.
3. **Preparation**: taking actions to accelerate work before it even begins
   improves efficiency.
4. **Collaborating**: harnessing the power of teamwork overcomes linear
   efficiency.
5. **Discussion**: sharing information achieves mutual understanding and eases
   collaboration.
6. **Shared understanding**: improves focus and collaboration.
7. **Learning**: obtaining knowledge is the base for improvement.
8. **Practice**: repeating processes improves performance.
9. **Measurements**: tracking performance metrics eases the problem of
   identifying inefficiency problems.
10. **Adjustments**: changing behavior and processess based on knowledge and
   measurements to improve.
11. **Borrowing brilliance**: obtaining knowledge from outer sources helps
   discovering new perspective.
12. **Evaluating results**: examining outcomes gives input to learning and
   adjusting.
13. **Focusing on the outcome**: resolving bigger picture problems yields
   results faster with less effort.

Everyone knows these values and principles inherently.

To integrate these principles into our habits, **we need practices, otherwise
  behaviors change and leave the principles behind**, they fade away.

### Principles

1. **Focus on the outcome**: begin with clarity about the outcome, let it guide
   every step along the way.
   (customer and business value)
2. **Iterate, be fast, flexible, adaptive and improve continuously**: listen,
   iterate, learn and course correct rather than wait until it's perfect.
3. **Collaborate and work as empowered, self directed teams**: encourage
   self-direction for teams to unleash innovation, instead of concentrating
   leadership in the hands of a selected few.

The values you walk past are the values you accept.

Problems need to be called out.

### 5 dysfunctions of a team

1. **Sense of invulnerability** -> **absences of trust**

   If the members of the team can’t share their past experiences and present
   thoughts, they will not trust each other enough to honestly discuss future
   goals for the team.

2. **Artificial harmony** -> **fear of conflict**:

   If the members of the team are concerned that their honest comments may throw
   off balance the ease they’ve created by holding back, then everyone will keep
   holding back.

3. **Ambiguity** -> **lack of commitment**:

   If the members of the team do not believe in the main goal of the team,
   ultimately, they will not support it.

4. **Low standards** -> **avoidance of accountability**:

   if the members of the team are concerned they will insult their peers by
   questioning their decisions, they won’t ask the hard questions.

5. **Status and ego** -> **inattention to results**:

   If the members of the team do not truly believe in the team’s ability to
   achieve an overarching goal, they will go rogue to save their individual
   career.

Agile values + Agile principles + Agile practices = change in behaviors (Agile,
Lean, DevOps, Design thinking)

### Samples of Agile practices

**Agile is about simplicity**: you find the problem, you will soon develop
practice to solve the problem as well.

- **Social contract**:
   1. Every team gets together for one hour.
   2. They write sticking notes about acceptable and inacceptable behaviors.
   3. This forms a list of behavior the team is going to live by.
   4. This is put up at the team space and the entire team owns it.
   5. Everyone is accountable according to that by all the team members.
   6. Penalties can be added to inacceptible behaviors as a weight.
- **Scale of expectations**:
   1. Trust is a set of expectations.
   2. 30m to sit down with your work partners and write sticky notes of your
      expectations towards your work partners and their expectetions of you.
   3. This forms a list of expectations you should live by and a list of
      expectations you can expect your work partners to live by.
- **Mood marbles**:
   1. At the team space.
   1. Jar of marbles, lot of red and green marbles in a big bowl.
   2. Another empty glass jar.
   3. Everyday when people come in the morning and when they leave in the
      evening they put one red or green marble in the jar depending on how they
      feel, green - good, red - bad.
   4. At the end of every day it is visible how the team is feeling.
- **Retrospective**:
   1. What is working well?
   2. What is going wrong?
   3. What was confusing?
   4. Collect key interests of the team based on the 3 categories above by
      aggregating lists of individual interests of the past iteration.
   5. Grouping them results 5-10 key problems the team have.
   6. The team should prioritize them and pick the top 3 to work on.
   7. Ask the team how it could fix those chosen problems until the next
      iteration.
- **Discovery+value stream mapping**:
- **Story cards**:
- **Wall of work**:
- **Showcase**:
- **Burn-up chart**:
- **Issue bulls eye**:
   1. put a target bulls eye on a paper onto the wall.
   2. Anyone when they feel they have an issue they can place a sticky note on
      the bulls eye with someone assigned to the issue.
   3. The closer the issue is to the center the more urgent or pressing it is.
   4. This way the team can visibly see when an issue is present and how urgent
      it is to solve the issue, also who is responsible the most for solving the
      issue.
- **Stand-up**: frequent habit of sharing knowledge about work progress.
    1. 1 minute speaking time.
    2. What did I do since the last stand-up?
    3. What will I do until the next stand-up?
    4. Are there any blockers?
    5. Can anyone help with the blockers?
- **Risk matrix**:

**Failure is okay**, it is the way we learn which **leads to success**, as long
as you **fail fast, learn from it and recover from it**.

Don't use documentation to achieve shared understanding, **document the achieved
share understandings**.

#### Shu - Ha - Ri

1. **Shu - follow**: when you are learning anything, you follow the because you
   don't know enough to understand why it is the way it is.
2. **Ha - break**: change the process to improve it.
3. **Ri - transcend**: Write your own process.

What makes a practice Agile?
If it **meets the values and principles of Agile** then it is an Agile practice.

## Agile leadership

#### Doing the right work.

#### Doing the work right.

Challanges of today:
- Too much work.
- Pressure to deliver.
- Stressed and/or disengaged teams.
- Missed targets.
- Suboptimal results.

**Growth is controlled** not by the total of resources available, but **by the
scarcest resource** - Liebig's Law of the Minimum.

You can only deliver as fast as the slowest part of your process. (Every
organization has at any given point in time at least one constrating which
limits the system's performance relative to its goal - Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt:
Form the Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement.)

#### The key is to find and replace the bottleneck where you want it to be.

Little's Law:
Work in progress = Throughput * Lead time
- **Work in progress**: average number of user stories being worked on.
- **Throughput**: number of stories completed in an iteration.
- **Lead time**: average time it takes to complete a story.

Consequences:
- Limit WIP to increase throughput.
- Limit WIP to reduce lead time.

Changing focus loses productivity, we are not good multitaskers.

### Doing the right work

1. Strategy:

   1. Mission and vision.
   2. Objectives and goals.
   3. Strategic initiatives.

2. Portfolio funnel of work:

   4. Strategic programs.

### Doing the work right

3. Delivery practices:

   5. Program delivery prectices.
   6. Operational delivery practices.

The teams **pull the works**, the works are not pushed onto them.

How much work a team can do is the **WIP limit**.

1. Small batch size.
2. Single prioritized funnel of work.
3. Pull work to match WIP limit.
4. Small, stable cross functional team.
5. Multiple teams are loosely coupled and tightly aligned.

### Leader responsibilities:

#### 1. Strategy - inspire purpose

A leader is someone organizing a group of people to achieve a common goal.

-  To have a common goal you need the clarity of purpose, you need strategy.
-  Strategy pattern: come up with the mission/vision, the goal to achieve,
   the bloackers and the milestones.
-  Strategy is about choice.
-  To make the best choices you have to work collaboratively.

#### 2. Structure - set up for success

- Right resources.
- Right place.
- Right time.

#### 3. 'Gembutsu' - optimize value flow

Gembutsu = go see the real thing
(See the facts with your own eyes, not through someone else's.)

- Remove bottlenecks.
- Eliminate waste.

#### 4. Work - govern for greatness

- **Doing the work right** - throttle the funnel.
- **Govern and steer** - keep the focus on the goal while maneuvering through
  the blockers.
- **Doing the work right** - implementing tactics for the processes of
  delivering programs and operations.

#### 5. Innovate - drive innovation

- Innovating.
- Sharing.
- Learning.
- Improving.

## Agile - Where, When, hoW and Why

### Patterns

1. Strategy and governance pattern.
2. Program execution pattern.
3. Operation execution pattern.

All patterns follow these phases:

1. Mobilize.
2. Understand.
3. Explore/strategize.
4. Build/test/implement.
5. Manage/evolve.

These phases are iterative, they can point back to previous phases for
improvement.

### Strategy and governance pattern in details
```
|  Mobilize    >     Understand     >     Explore/strategize      >     Build/test/implement    >     Manage/evolve  |
|                                                                                                                    |
| Where are we | Where do we want   |     How do we get there?    |    What do we need to do?   | How do we execute? |
| now?         | to be?             |                             |                             |                    |
|                                                                 |                                                  |
|                       Strategy formulation                      |               Strategy execution                 |
```

- Collaborate to elaborate.
- Iterate through all levels down.
- Portfolio governance provides the feedback to strategy.

1. **Where are we now?**
   - Business model canvas.
      - Existing strategy.
      - Business metrics.
      - Work in progress.
   - Market factors.
   - Current problems.
   - Root cause analysis.
   - SWOT analysis.
2. **Where do we want to be?**
   - Vision (distant mountains).
   - Mission (purpose).
   - Objectives (hills).
   - BHAG: big hairy audacious goal.
   - SMART goals: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound.
3. **How do we get there?**
   - Design workshops.
   - Top 3-5 blockers to achieving the goals.
   - Foundational beliefs.
   - Strategic options.
   - Strategic choices.
   - Strategic initiatives.
4. **What do we need to do?**
   - High level timeline.
   - Short term (next 3 months) top 3 priorities.
   - Budget-strategy alignment.
5. **How do we execute?**
   - Strategic pipeline.
   - Start-stop-continue.
   - Integrated WIP.
   - Strategy modality.


#### Strategies of the higher levels become goals for the lower levels.

### Program execution pattern in details
```
|  Mobilize    >     Understand     >     Explore/strategize      >     Build/test/implement    >     Manage/evolve  |
|      |                                           |                                                                 |
| Idea |                 Discover                  |                           Deliver                               |
|      |                                           |                                                                 |
| *    |         Understand and strategize         | Governance / Funding gates, iteratively build, test and deliver |

* Strategic initiative
New recruitment
Enhancement
Problem
Opportunity
```

1. **Discovery brief**: take the idea and create one page write down of the
   problem taking an hour, by the person who is initiating it.
2. **Discovery cycle**: 5 days tops.

### Operation execution pattern in details

Delivery life-cycle
```
|     Discovery (optional)    |               Delivery (releases or phases)               |
|                             |                                                           |
|     Iteration 0    |     Iteration 1    |     Iteration 2       |     Iteration n       |
|                    |                                                                    |
|        Setup       |                                                                    |
|                                                                                         |
|                                       Iteration n                                       |
|  Iteration planning  |  Daily stand-ups  |  Work  |  Showcase  |      Retrospective     |
|                      |                            |                                     |
|         Ready        |             Run            |                 Wrap                |
```

1. Iteration time fixed to 2 weeks (1 is too short for Agile starters).
2. First day of the iteration do the planning.
3. Keep doing the stand-up/work iterations.
4. At the end of the iteration, the last day do the showcase to the
   stakeholders.
5. Retrospective after the showcase, it is mainly about the process, not the
   product.

Similar to Scrum methodology.

Agile teams share the responsibility of improving.

```
|  Mobilize    >     Understand     >     Explore/strategize      >     Build/test/implement    >     Manage/evolve  |

   - People?
   - Inputs/Outputs?
   - Metrics?

3. Test hypothesis:

   - Agile project.

4. Roll-out to all areas and evolve:

#### You are responsible to the team and to yourself

Distributed teams have to have agreements, standards, tools and processes.

#### Rules for distributed teams

   1. Don't do distributed teams if you can avoid it.
   2. Don't treat remotes as they were locals.
   3. Don't treat locals as they were remotes.
   4. Latitude hurts, longitude kills.
   5. Don't always be remote.
   6. Invest in the appropriate tools and environments.
   7. Establish standards and agreements.

#### DNA for success

   1. Agile exposes **capability gaps**.
   3. **Attitude**: you don't want a toxic brilliant team.
   4. **Aptitude**: you don't want a happy underperforming team.
   2. **Awesome capability**: high performing teams are happy and highly
      capable.
   5. Agile helps creating a **great working culture**.

#### Pitfalls

   1. Environment:

      1. Wrong physical environment.
      2. Lack of proper tools.
      3. Funnel not managed - too much WIP.
      4. Resources splintered and working on multiple projects.

   2. Knowledge:

      4. Lack of sharing.
      5. No access to coaching.

   3. Leadership:

      1. Leaders don't walk the talk.
      2. Wrong leadership style: command and control instead of servant
         leadership.
      3. Lack of a clear shared purpose and strategy.
      4. Lack of trust.

   4. Capability:

      1. Poor core capability.
      2. Lack of capable Agile PMs and IMs.
      3. Lack of critical thinking for problem solving.
      4. Can't do attitude.

#### 7 key impacts

   2. Team structure.
   3. Work environment.
   4. Work prioritization.
   5. Leadership style.
   6. Making time to collaborate.
   7. Authentic transparency.

#### Why agile?

   1. Happy people.
   2. Improved quality.
   3. Reduced risk and cost.
   4. Increased revenue.
