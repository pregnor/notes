2. **Objective**: in the chosen topic you **MUST** think of an outcome you are/your team is set to achieve in the calendar year.
3. **Milestone**: you **MUST** select a point on the path towards that objective which you see as a clearly distinguishable checkpoint and is achievable in the calendar year with regular effort or with not much extra work over that.
    Note: take shifting priorities, changes in resourcing, business direction and priorities into account.
4. **Goal**: you **MUST** convert the milestone into a goal by defining as much of the following criteria as you can
    1. Expected outcome: you **SHOULD** clearly define what you want to achieve, the completed/finished/done state of the goal.

    8. Dimensions: you **MUST** categorize the goal by the available dimensions and explain for each selected dimension which part of the goal is related to that particular dimension.
5. **Reality check**: you **MUST** review the complete goal description to have a clear picture on its feasibility.
